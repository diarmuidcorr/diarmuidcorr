- 👋 Hi, I’m @diarmuidcorr
- 🏢 I'm a PhD student at Lancaster University.
- 👀 I’m interested in the remote sensing of earth's major ice sheets (Antarctica and Greenland) and in particular methods used to map supraglacial hydrology.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my knowledge on machine learning approaches to classify these surface water features from optical satellite imagery.
